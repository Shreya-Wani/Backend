# Backend Learning Repository 🚀

This repository documents my **Backend Development Learning Journey** using **Node.js** and related technologies.  
It includes multiple practice projects, covering everything from the basics of HTTP servers to a structured **Express Book Store** application.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure & Learnings

### 1️⃣ Basics_of_express
- Explored the **fundamentals of Express.js**.
- Learned how to set up a server, handle routes, and use request/response methods.

---

### 2️⃣ Buffer_Understanding
- Gained an understanding of **Node.js Buffers**.
- Practiced handling **binary data** in Node.js.

---

### 3️⃣ Different_Http_Task
- Worked with **different HTTP methods** (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- Learned how to build APIs directly using the Node.js `http` module.

---

### 4️⃣ Express-Book-Store 📚
A **mini backend project** to manage **Books and Authors** using Express.js.  
This project covers real-world backend concepts:

- **Routes** → Separate routes for `books` and `authors`.
- **Controllers** → Clean business logic separation.
- **Modules** → Organized reusable code.
- **Middlewares** → Logging, validation, and error handling.
- **CRUD Operations** → Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality.

> 🏆 This is the most complete project in the repo and reflects a **production-like Express structure**.

---

### 5️⃣ Modules [How export-import works]
- Practiced **module exports and imports** in Node.js.
- Learned the difference between **CommonJS (`require`)** and **ES Modules (`import`)**.

---

### 6️⃣ Modules
- Explored accessing and organizing files in Node.js projects.

---

### 7️⃣ MoreFunctional_http
- Built a **custom HTTP server** with more advanced functionalities.

---

### 8️⃣ Node-ORM
- Installed and configured **Drizzle ORM** with **PostgreSQL**.
- Learned how Node.js integrates with databases using an ORM.

---

### 9️⃣ basic todo-task
- Created a **simple To-Do app**.
- Practiced **CRUD operations** and basic task management.

---

### 🔟 events_Understanding
- Worked with **Event Emitters** in Node.js.
- Understood how events support **asynchronous programming**.

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ first_basic_http_server
- Built my **first HTTP server** using the Node.js `http` module.
- Learned how requests and responses are handled.

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ second_Basic_Server
- Extended the functionality of the first HTTP server.
- Practiced handling multiple routes and dynamic responses.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Drizzle ORM** (PostgreSQL)
- **JavaScript (ES6)**

---

## 📖 Learning Highlights
- Core **Node.js concepts**: Buffers, Modules, Events, HTTP.
- Building REST APIs with **Express.js**.
- Structuring backend projects with **routes, controllers, middlewares**.
- Hands-on practice with **CRUD operations**.
- Database integration with **ORMs**.
- Improved understanding of **scalable backend architecture**.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add **Authentication & Authorization** (JWT, sessions).  
- Implement a **User Authentication System** (login/register).  
- Add **data validation layers** with middleware.  
- Build an advanced **REST API** with proper MVC structure.  
- Explore **GraphQL** and **WebSockets**.
