# Backend Learning Repository üöÄ

This repository documents my **Backend Development Learning Journey** using **Node.js** and related technologies.  
It includes multiple practice projects, covering everything from the basics of HTTP servers to a structured **Express Book Store** application with routes, controllers, and middlewares.

---

## üìÇ Folder Structure & Learnings

### 1. Basics_of_express
- Explored the **fundamentals of Express.js**.
- Learned how to set up a server, handle routes, and use request/response methods.

---

### 2. Buffer_Understanding
- Gained an understanding of **Node.js Buffers**.
- Practiced handling **binary data** in Node.js.

---

### 3. Different_Http_Task
- Worked with **different HTTP methods** (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- Learned how to build APIs directly using the Node.js `http` module.

---

### 4. Express-Book-Store üìö
A **mini backend project** to manage **Books and Authors** using Express.js.  
This project showcases how real-world applications are structured:

- **Routes** ‚Üí Separate routes for `books` and `authors`.
- **Controllers** ‚Üí Business logic handled separately for clarity and maintainability.
- **Modules** ‚Üí Reusable code structured into modules.
- **Middlewares** ‚Üí Implemented custom middlewares for logging, validation, and error handling.
- **CRUD Operations** ‚Üí Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for both books and authors.

This project reflects a **production-like backend structure**, making it one of the most important parts of this repo.

---

### 5. Modules [How export-import works]
- Practiced **module exports and imports** in Node.js.
- Learned the difference between **CommonJS** (`require`) and **ES Modules** (`import`).

---

### 6. Modules
- Worked on **accessing files** and organizing code in Node.js projects.

---

### 7. MoreFunctional_http
- Created a **custom HTTP server** with more advanced functionalities compared to the first basic server.

---

### 8. Node-ORM
- Installed and configured **Drizzle ORM** with **PostgreSQL**.
- Explored how Node.js interacts with databases using ORM.

---

### 9. basic todo-task
- Built a **simple To-Do app**.
- Practiced implementing **CRUD operations** and data handling.

---

### 10. events_Understanding
- Learned about **Event Emitters** in Node.js.
- Explored how events support asynchronous programming in backend systems.

---

### 11. first_basic_http_server
- Built my **first HTTP server** using Node.js core `http` module.
- Learned how requests and responses are handled under the hood.

---

### 12. second_Basic_Server
- Extended the functionality of the first HTTP server.
- Handled multiple routes and dynamic responses.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Drizzle ORM** (with PostgreSQL)
- **JavaScript (ES6)**

---

## üìñ Learning Highlights
- Core **Node.js concepts**: Buffers, Modules, Events, HTTP.
- Building APIs with **Express.js**.
- Real-world backend structure with **routes, controllers, and middlewares**.
- Hands-on practice with **CRUD operations**.
- Integration of **ORM (Drizzle) with PostgreSQL**.
- Structuring backend projects for scalability.

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Add **Authentication & Authorization** examples (JWT, sessions).  
- Build a **User Authentication System** with login/register.  
- Implement **validation layers** using middleware.  
- Create an advanced **REST API** with proper MVC structure.  
- Explore **GraphQL** and **WebSockets** for real-time applications.

## üìå How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shreya-Wani/Backend.git
   cd Backend
````

2. Navigate into any folder (for example, Express-Book-Store):

   ```bash
   cd NodeJs/Express-Book-Store
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the server:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Test endpoints (example for **Express-Book-Store**):

   * **Books API** ‚Üí `http://localhost:3000/books`
   * **Authors API** ‚Üí `http://localhost:3000/authors`
